BabylonHx
=========

Port of JavaScript/WebGL engine BabylonJS to Haxe programming language and OpenFL framework.

BabylonHx is a direct port of BabylonJs engine to Haxe/OpenFL. 
It supports (almost) all features of the original.

Not supported features:

Video textures
Image flipping (images have to be flipped by 'hand')
Incremental loading (because of OpenFL and its way of handling assets)
Support for drag'n'drop
Physics
And probably a few more things ...

Known bugs (major ones):
There is a but with lights (PointLight), most noticable in 'Train' and 'Heart' demos.
