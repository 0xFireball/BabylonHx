BabylonHx
=========

BabylonHx is a direct port of BabylonJs engine to Haxe/OpenFL. 
It supports (almost) all features of the original.

**IMPORTANT:** Use this settings in your application.xml file for mobile targets to work (thanks @labe-me):<br/>
***&lt;window require-shaders="true" hardware="true" depth-buffer="true" /&gt;***
